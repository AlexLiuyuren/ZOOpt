# Optimization Example on Simple Functions

In `example.pl`, there are some examples of optimizing simple functions defined in `fx.pl`

Four simple functions in `fx.pl`

* `sphere`: a convex hyper-sphere function in real dimensions

* `ackley`: a non-convex ackley function with many local optima in real dimensions

* `setcover`: an instance of the NP-hard minimum set cover problem in discrete dimensions

* `mixed_function`: a sum-of-all-dimension function for mixed real/discrete dimensions

In `example.pl`,  the main program has four sections separated by `if`. Each section is an example for minimzing one function.
