# ZOO
A python package of Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), including RACOS(SRACOS) and POSS.

# RACOS
A theoretically-grounded derivative-free optimization method, born from a statistical view of evolutionary algorithms. More details can be found in the paper:

# Sequential RACOS (SRACOS)
SRACOS is the online version of RACOS, which can be much faster than RACOS in online scenarios, where solutions have to be evaluated one after another. For example, on policy optimization in OpenAI Gym tasks with 2000 iterations, the experiment comparison is as the figure below, normalzied by the performance of SRACOS:
